Retexture for various items from Clockwork and Steam. May work for both 1.5 version and the original, but that is untested.

I love the premise of the mod, but a lot of the textures stand out far too much from Rimworld's style. This aims to fix that and to redesign some things that looked a bit too ridiculous.
